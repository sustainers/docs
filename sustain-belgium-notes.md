**Facilitator(s):** Pia  
**Note taker(s):** B. Norberg  

## Notes: 

- Goal for the session is to establish best practices for good docs
- Let’s start with identifying who we are writing the docs for. What are the different audience personas for docs? Who is reading docs? 
  - List of items on sticky notes:
    - Beginners
    - Employees doing their job
    - Developers
    - Contributors
    - Users of the software
    - Sponsors
    - Designers
    - Other documentarians
    - Earth
    - Search engines
- It is very hard to write for beginners, but how could it be easy?
- What should we ask ourselves when we write documentation? What do the readers want?
- Good practices / things to include in docs
  - Involve people who have no clue
  - Explain it to your parents
  - Friction logs
  - Guided tours / dictionary / glossary / wiki
  - Adding communications channels (how to get in touch with people)
  - How to participate and report, tailored to the project itself, through references
  - Examples
  - Use cases to show how it works without having to download packages
  - Snippets of how it works
  - Compare to other projects (links)
- Github repositories should have
  - Description of what the project is not a fit for
  - Website
  - Doc.domain
  - Communication channels
  - Contributing.md
  - Security.md
- Bad practices / things not to include in docs
  - Including jargon
- Challenges to creating good docs
  - Road to simplicity is complex
  - Ordering and organizing documentation. You don’t want redundancy / duplicative docs floating around
  - Docs need to be maintained
- How people write docs:
  - Gitbook
  - Docusaurus 
  - ReadMe
    - Often more technical, and better suited for developers with context rather than beginners 
  - Yay doc
  - Github wiki
- Making life easier for contributors:
  - Bug report/fix template
  - For people that just want to learn and have fun, explaining what the project is and what they can find.
  - How to set up the environment
  - Include a sense of why things are the way they are (sometimes there are good reasons for carrying technical debt)
  - How your label system works
  - Have a roadmap that can be shared
  - Contributor License Agreements (CLAs)
  - Time expectations
    - Estimates of how long it should take to review / merge
  - Acknowledgement
    - How can you expect to be rewarded
  - Code style
  - Commit standards
  - Expectations
    - What types of contributions are in scope and out
- How to contribute to docs for other documentarians:
  - Describe where they exist
  - Style guide
  - Linking system
  - Watch out for headings and links
  - If getting published to a website, explain the system that builds the docs
  - Cheat sheets (i.e., markdown)
  - International structure (translate)
- What to include for sponsors:
  - Metrics
  - Donate button
  - Expense policies
  - Expectation setting
  - Success stories
    - Include what you have done with the money
  - Find a way to tell people that you’re looking for sponsors

## Session outcomes and action items:
- Every project needs good docs
- You have different people coming to your docs. Write and consider the following:
  - Sponsors
  - Beginners
  - Designers
  - Contributors
  - Search engines
  - Other documentarians
  - International contributors
- Build a repo with all of these good practices / personas / checklists and where it’s going to live
